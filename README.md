**Taskover** is a simple and fast todo list with Vim-like keybindings made in `Python`.

- Add tasks swiftly, mark them as done and delete them when you're finished.
- If you use Vim, this program's commands will be familiar.

This program is minimal and only requires Python 3. If you know some Python, it's easy to hack and change this program to suit your needs.
